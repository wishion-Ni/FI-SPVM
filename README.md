# FI-SPVM

This repository is organized into two directories:

- `lib/`: Core library headers and implementations for the spectral variational model (e.g., ADMM, dictionary generation, component analysis utilities).
- `src/`: Application entry points and orchestration code (e.g., `SolverApp` and the `trSPVSolver` executable).

Configuration samples (`config.json`) remain at the repository root.
